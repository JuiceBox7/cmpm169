			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I referenced a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/awesomeadi00/sketches/KtFZu1yp-">piece</a> I found online. I was very lost in what to do for this experiment and it took me a long time to figure out what to do. I couldn't 
					find a lot of good references on most websites, but found this off of Google and really liked the concept and design. Part of why it stood out to me was the fact that it wasn't using any kind of real data, which was one of my main concerns for 
					this experiment. I didn't have any ideas of any data that I could use for this assignment, but the idea of using fictional information in this way was very appealing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For the integration step, there wasn't too much that needed to be done in order to integrate it with my idea, since my idea would basically be taking this concept and expanding upon it, with my own unique information and planet designs. However, 
					due to how I did this experiment, my integration step and innovation step are closely related in what I did for each of them. I had to get my own images for the planets, as well as make my own csv file, for easier integration. Most of my work 
					came from creating this csv file, as well as adding some fields for additional information, which I'll talk about more under innovation. I also had to change the size of the rect used as the background for the planet's information, to account 
					for my additional fields.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For innovation, I added some fields as I mentioned earlier. With the way that it was coded beforehand, I had to be extremely particular about the mouse offset, to ensure that the text looked in uniform with the rest of the text that already 
					existed. A lot of my time was spent creating the csv file, which I decided to do within Visual Studio Code, despite the process maybe being much more simple through Excel or Google Sheets. I wrote up to 49 unique planet descriptions, and copy 
					and pasted the results up to 197 lines, meaning that the user has exactly 196 functioning clicks until they run out of planets and need to reload the page. By prior design the planet image that is used for each planet is random, which was a nice 
					touch.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this assignment on my own, taking inspiration from a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/awesomeadi00/sketches/KtFZu1yp-">piece</a> I found online. I had a lot of trouble figuring out what to do for this experiment, but am happy 
						with the result I came up with.</li>
					<li>I feel that I did a good job on this experiment, and feel that I was able to add more levels of complexity, as well as having fun names, many of which referenced from Star Wars, and helped me get more familiar with csv files. This 
						assignment demanded a lot of reading and understanding of lots of pre written code to understand how to expand upon it.</li>
					<li>The highs of the experiment were being able to add to a cool idea I found online. While this may have not been the most unique experiment, I am happy with the result and work I put into this experiment. As for the lows, I had a really hard 
						time with this assignment, and was very lost on what it is that I should make. None of the examples from the usual websites I use were very easy to understand, meaning it was very difficult to imitate from, which led to me looking on the 
						Web. I wish the experiment could've been more unique, but still believe it came out well for the time I had left to complete the experiment.</li>
