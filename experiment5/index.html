			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I referenced a <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/843038">piece</a> from 
					<a href="https://openprocessing.org/">OpenProcessing</a>. I decided to head to 
					<a href="https://openprocessing.org/">OpenProcessing</a>, since I didn't use it a ton in the past, besides some minor 
					research into L-Systems. I found a really interesting work with interactive elements that I found to be really 
					interesting and fun. I enjoyed the spiraling tunnel aspect, as well as the ability to change the shape and dimension 
					of the polygons. So I decided to base my experiment off of this piece, while adding some features and tweaking a few 
					aspects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>My main goal was to add a color aspect, without doing anything that would make the art harder to look at than it 
					might've already been. I also wanted to change the speed at which the shapes rotated, as well as making it dynamic to 
					fit the dimension of the tunnel. To do this, I scaled down numFigures to be lower, as well as the figureSeparation. I 
					also changed rotSpeed to be a mutable variable rather than a constant, and lowered it by 0.004 as well, to be at the 
					bottom of the range of speeds I wanted to allow. The higher the dimension, the slower the shapes will rotate, making it 
					easier on the eyes to observe what's happening. The same applies for lower dimensions, meaning lowering the dimension 
					will also increase the rotation speed, up to 0.01. I also had to change the color mode from HSB (Hue, Saturation, 
					Brightness) to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) in order for colors to be as customizable as I had envisioned.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>There was a small amount of innovation in integration, as I needed to set up proper variables and systems in order to 
					manipulate the code in the way that I wanted. I could have included the changing of the rotation speed, but felt that 
					it was a change that could be easily missed, so I included it in integration. For innovation, I mainly focused on 
					getting the color aspect down. At first, I made the color change randomly each time draw() was called, but as I had 
					half expected it didn't look great, as well as could probably cause epilepsy. Thus, I brainstormed having each one 
					changed whenever a shape changed. However, after testing this change out as well, I realized that users might find a 
					color they really like and might want to experiment with the various shapes and dimensions in that color. So, I decided 
					to assign color changing to a key, independent of changing shapes and dimensions. I also figured that people might want 
					to have a bit more control of the color values, but I didn't want to ditch my random color approach. So, I made 
					individual keys for each respective RGB color value as well. I also added instructions on how to interact with the 
					piece, as there are many different keys mapped to different functions. I also added an event listener for any key that 
					could scroll the page, and prevented any scrolling from happening for ease of use.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this assignment on my own, taking inspiration from an art piece on 
						<a href="https://openprocessing.org/">OpenProcessing</a>. All changes made to the code were my own, and all 
						innovation onto the original piece were also my own.</li>
					<li>I feel that I did a good job on this experiment, and feel that I was able to achieve the color changing exactly 
						the way I wanted. I also impressed myself when considering allowing users to change each individual color value as 
						well.</li>
					<li>The highs of the experiment were being able to add color in a non dominating way to the already trippy looking 
						tunnel. I was happy with the added interaction I added, as well as the tweaks I made for even easier viewing. As 
						for the lows, I had a hard time coming up with what to do for this experiment. I had found a really cool piece, but 
						was unsure what I could do to add or mesh with any other art piece I also came across. Therefore I wasn't able to 
						work and innovate as much as I wanted this week. Nonetheless, I tried my best and spent a good amount of time 
						experimenting and trying things out.</li>
