			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I looked at the references on the <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design website</a> and took two as inspiration. The first 
					one I took some inspiration from was a piece that traced a semi transparent ring across a blank white canvas, and the 
					semi transparent black stroke color allowed it to essentially shade the page. I thought the shading effect to be really 
					cool, and decided to take this piece of code from it to incorporate into my experiment. As for the second piece I used 
					as inspiration, it was a piece that mirrored what was drawn with the mouse in 8 directions stemming from the center.</p>
				<a href="//www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_3_7_01">Here is the first piece I referenced</a><br>
				<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_3_01">And here is the other</a>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For integration, I put these ideas and pieces together to make a confusing/unique way of drawing on a canvas, along with 
					it being semi transparent so that it can have the shading effect. The “stroke(0, 50);” line is how the stroke becomes 
					semi transparent, and everything else is to edit the background, cursor, and width of the stroke. I then use some math 
					to have fun with the lines that are drawn in the draw() function. The math essentially mirrors the mouse's x and y 
					coordinates between the negative, negative quadrant and positive, positive quadrant of the canvas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For the innovation part of the process, I used my JavaScript knowledge to give the canvas an event listener for click, 
					as simply checking to see if the mouse is clicked in the draw function can lead to errors, since it's called per frame. 
					This allowed for it to be more user friendly, as it just reads the click, and waits until the user completes the click 
					(releasing left-click) to fire the event. Instead of calling the draw function from the event listener, I simply change 
					a boolean variable which is checked in the draw function, to call two functions, as well as draw the lines. The 
					UpdateMousePos() function updates the x,y variables to be the mouse's coordinates, and updateNum() decreases the value 
					of num up to 0.5, then “resets it” to get some interesting line results.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this assignment on my own, taking inspiration from the 
						<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design website</a> on the direction the experiment 
						would take. I tested a lot of different math equations to get interesting results for the line() function, but 
						settled with the current results.</li>
					<li>I feel that I did a good job on this experiment, and demonstrated each step of the imitate, integrate, innovate 
						process along the way. I successfully created a fun interactive art piece, using vector art in a dynamic, fun way. 
						It was a lot of fun to slowly evolve the wackiness of the drawing, and found it is very efficient at drawing 
						ship-like objects.</li>
					<li>The highs of the experiment were getting to see the slow evolution of my experiment to what it is currently. It was 
						a lot more satisfying to look at when adding the semi-transparent lines. I am much more familiar with p5.js, and am 
						confident in improving my skills with each experiment in this class from here on out. The lows were maybe not being 
						able to spend as much time as I would have liked, due to other class work.</li>
