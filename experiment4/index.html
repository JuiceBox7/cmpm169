			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I referenced the idea of using video for our experiment from class, and also a piece from 
					<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design</a>. The piece from 
					<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design</a> really captivated me, as it took an image and 
					warped it in a way that resembled a wet canvas. I really wanted to use this idea and mesh it using video, and decided 
					this was best done by taking a frame from the video feed and warping that frame. From the piece I referenced, I would 
					mainly need a block of code that did the warping effect on the image.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For integration, I added the code block I mentioned above, as well as put in the lines of code that are needed to 
					capture video in p5js. Since the warping just warped whatever was on the canvas, be it image or text, it was very 
					easy to mesh these two ideas together. In the art that I referenced, they used an image they had saved, but in my 
					case I just replaced the image with video. I changed a few things from the warping code, but for the most part kept 
					things in tact. Essentially I changed a few values. There wasn't a lot of time or steps spent on integration, as most 
					of my time was spent in figuring out what to imitate and how to innovate on that.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For this step, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to best utilize the video effect with the warping effect. 
					Since the draw() function gets called every frame, a new image is being drawn over the old one, which essentially 
					covers up all the warping that is done in that same frame. This creates a sort of “glitchy” camera feel which is cool, 
					but loses the warped “watery” feel I enjoyed about the piece I found and used as inspiration.  After a lot of thinking 
					and trying a few ideas out, one being that a frame is taken and warped every 10 seconds, I came to the conclusion that 
					the warping effect does need quite a bit of time and it would be difficult to do with live video. However, it did lead 
					me to what would be my final design. I made it so that there would be a countdown that would begin on clicking the 
					container, and at the end of the container the first frame supplied from the camera will be used as the photo that gets 
					warped.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this assignment on my own, taking inspiration from an art piece on 
						<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design</a>, as well as the idea of using video from 
						lecture. All changes made to the code I referenced for the warping effect was my own. </li>
					<li>I feel that I did a good job on this experiment, and feel that I was able to innovate a lot more than I was able to 
						last week. I spent a good amount of time ideating how to innovate and properly get the two ideas to work together 
						exactly as I wanted, even if they both functionally worked together very easily. I am proud of what I was able to 
						come up with in the time given.</li>
					<li>The highs of the experiment were being able to effectively flesh out my idea of using video feed and warping frames 
						of the video feed, even if it resulted in just one frame, I believe it was for the best. I enjoyed adding some text 
						and making it a bit interactive as well. As for the lows, there weren't really any lows during this experiment per 
						se, as everything went as smoothly as it could've and I enjoyed the process.</li>
