			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I mainly referenced the L-System example shown in class as inspiration for my own generative art 
					piece. Most of the examples I found online were interesting and often involved a tree like structure, utilizing how 
					L-Systems branch. However, the one shown in class stood out the most to me, as I enjoyed seeing how the piece evolved. 
					I also referenced some code provided by ChatGPT to refine the rules.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For integration, I put these two references together to try and create something a little more unique. So, to start I 
					experimented a ton with the rules to try and get the pattern to sort of spiral in a clockwise fashion. Even with the 
					help of ChatGPT to help figure out the math of it, it still needed tweaking to get to something I liked. I also called 
					back to my experiment 2 and how it was really cool to mess with transparency. So I leaned into this and even changed the 
					background of the canvas to be black, for the colors and transparency to stand out more. Most of the time spent on this 
					step really was getting the rules to match the result in my mind, which was for the shapes to spiral algorithmically 
					from the center of the canvas outwards, allowing for running over old shapes to take advantage of the transparency 
					aspect, and have fun with the different colors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For this step, some of what was done in the integration step also overlaps, such as the expanding on the rules, colors, 
					changing the shapes, and overall changing the systematic spreading of shapes that the example from class had to appear 
					much more random and chaotic. When taking a closer look at the results of my experiment, you can notice that there are 
					many squares within squares, each (mostly) having a unique color within the other squares, which I felt to be really 
					cool and interesting to look at. The most noticeable changes would be me switching the color and shape code to fit my 
					theme a bit more, as well as changing the background color.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this assignment on my own, taking inspiration from the example and class and using ChatGPT to help with 
						coming up with my own rule that would best capture the pattern of spiraling shapes through the use of L-Systems.</li>
					<li>I feel that I did a good job on this experiment, although I would have liked to maybe expand more upon the code. 
						Unfortunately, L-Systems are complicated to learn and bend to your will in a short amount of time. Overall, I spent 
						a lot of time and effort in trying to understand and experiment with the rules to get the result I wanted.</li>
					<li>The highs of the experiment were being able to get as close to what I had in mind with my minimal knowledge of 
						L-Systems. I ended up with a product I generally like, and is honestly better than I had expected, albeit simple. 
						The lows are that I would've liked to make something a bit more unique, but due to limited time combined with the 
						assignments of other classes, it can be a bit difficult to do so.</li>
