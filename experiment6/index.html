				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I referenced a <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_2_5_01">piece</a> from <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design</a>. I had a hard time deciding what to do for this 
					experiment compared to the last ones, as most of the examples I saw were fairly simple and mostly similar. The ones that were the most different didn't catch my attention as much as previous references for my past experiments did. The piece I 
					chose was the most interesting out of all of them I had seen, as it had more complexity to the code. It allowed for users to change the density, as well as move the mouse to mess with the pixels portraying the code. I found this to be very 
					interesting and decided to use this as my reference and add more features onto it, to innovate upon it.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>First thing was first though, I had to integrate it properly and set it up with my ideas. This meant I had to tweak a few things in order for it to fit my grander vision and end goal for this experiment. This means I had to add a few checks for 
					when users were focused on the canvas, and while I couldn't get this fully working, it's working enough to cover the bare minimum of what I wanted to achieve. So, I added a boolean called “focused” to check when users were focused, and only 
					allowed certain functions to run if the user was focused on the canvas. I also used event listeners and referenced some code from my past experiment to make typing and interacting with the product more user friendly. I had to make quite a few 
					event listeners, as I added some functionality that uses the mouse, meaning I couldn't have other events firing while users interacted with mine, or else it would be annoying to use.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Most of what was done for this experiment was done in the innovation step, as I tweaked the framerate to be 60 instead of 25, as well as changing the background to be black. Changing the background to black was done for the program to be easier 
					to look at, as having a white background with such bright colors can hurt the user's eyes. I also changed the framerate so that the pixels would move smoother. I also added zoom functionality, which allows users to zoom in and out to their 
					liking, giving the option to examine the pixels at either a close or far distance. I also added two new keys for further interactivity. I use the escape key to allow users to reset the zoom back to the default zoom, and shift for displaying one 
					of ten haikus I have set up in a list. I also changed the default text to be instructions of how to use the program, instead of type & code.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this assignment on my own, taking inspiration from <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design</a>, and coming up with my own ideas to add onto the piece. Some ideas were able to be generated due to past 
						experiments.</li>
					<li>I feel that I did a good job on this experiment, and feel that I was able to add more levels of interactivity, as well as the whole haiku thing, which is exactly what I wanted to do with this experiment. It was hard to come up with something 
						for this one, so I mainly wanted to add and feel that I achieved exactly that.</li>
					<li>The highs of the experiment were being able to test a bunch of features and get the ones I really wanted to work. I didn't mention it, but I also wanted to add mouse dragging but noticed it didn't quite work well with the already existing 
						mouse interactivity, and didn't want to lose that. I also messed around with the framerate a decent amount and decided 60 was perfect. As for the lows, it would have to be my difficulty of finding out what to imitate from. With the last 
						experiments, it felt that there was much more room for different ideas to combine and still fall into the same category, but this one, to me personally, felt a bit smaller in terms of room to innovate.</li>
